Building footprints for the microplanning map.

Overture publishes its buildings as a PMTiles archive and Mapbox GL reads PMTiles natively, so the
browser fetches footprints straight from Overture. This module only works out what to point it at:
there is no proxy view, no cache and no table behind the overlay, and no building data passes
through this process.

The one thing needing care is the release. Overture's buckets drop everything older than 60 days,
so a release that is fine today is a dead URL in two months -- see ``OVERTURE_RELEASE``.
"""

# The Overture release footprints are read from. Overture keeps only the two most recent releases
# -- its buckets carry a 60 day retention rule -- so this has to move forward every month or so,
# which currently means a deploy. Pinned here rather than in settings because it is not per
# environment: every environment wants the same, current release.

# A fact about the archive, handed to the Mapbox *source* as `maxzoom`: Overture builds tiles down
# to zoom 14 and no deeper. Declaring it is what makes Mapbox overzoom those z14 tiles for closer
# views; without it Mapbox requests z15+ tiles that do not exist and the overlay comes up empty.

# Our display policy, handed to the Mapbox *layers* as `minzoom`: the zoom at which footprints
# start being drawn at all.
#
# Set to the archive's max zoom, so footprints appear at Overture's own deepest tiles and are drawn
# at native resolution there; only the zooms past it are overzoomed. These two are not a range --
# one is a property of the data, this one is a choice.
#
# Do not drop it below the archive max. z14 is the last complete level: Overture thins the lower
# zooms hard (a z13 tile over Kibera carries about a fifth of the buildings its z14 tiles do), so
# drawing there would show a partial set of buildings while looking complete.
